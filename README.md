# Tic-Tac-Toe
A children's game

This was an exercise completed in the context of the Dunder Data Courses.

How to Play:

1. Create a new empty board for a new game:
```
board = create_empty_board()
```
2. Begin playing by making your first move with the play() function. Pass in the board itself as the first argument, the letter corresponding to the team that you are, and then the row (0-2) and column (0-2) where you would like to place your mark:
```
play(board, 'x', 1, 1)
```
